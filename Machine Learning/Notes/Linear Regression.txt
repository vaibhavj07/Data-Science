Linear Regression
-------------------
Data did nto constain discrete values, and contained continous values. 

1. y = mx + c (m -> slope, c-> intercept)
	x -> input value

Least Square Method
-----------------------
Get mean values of x and y, calculate gradient m by multiplying the differences

x,y <b>

x_mean, y_mean <br>

m = sum((x-x_mean) (y - y_mean))/sum(x-x_mean)^2
b = y_mean - m*x_mean
